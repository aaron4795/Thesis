Hello, Recruiter!

If you’re reading this, I hope it’s a good sign regarding my application!

On this GitHub, you will find the code I used for my dissertation titled "Més que un pago: del estilo Barça y la victoria en LaLiga" (translated: "More than a payment: the Barça style and victory in LaLiga"), 
where I analyze the correlation between the bribes made by the Football Club Barcelona to the former vice president of the Technical Committee of Referees and the goal difference of the team in the 
context of the Negreira Case.

If you’d like to learn more about the case, you can search for "Negreira case."

I hope you find it interesting! Lmk your thoughts!

For details on the project structure and how the codes relate to each other, please refer to the Excel file: Codes HIERARCHY.xlsx

Lastly, as a challenge and a way to enhance my Python skills, I'm in the process of "translating" my codes from STATA to Python. 
While I'm not finished yet, you can find some codes in their respective folder.

I apologize for the delay — balancing work and studying for CFA Level I takes up most of my time, but I try to dedicate time to this, especially on Python Tuesdays!
